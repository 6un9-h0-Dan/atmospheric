Atmospheric Toolbox
===========

**Atmospheric Toolbox** is a set of Matlabï¿½ tools for 
accessing, analyzing, and visualizing atmospheric data. 
Large datasets, complex data formats, and incompatible 
tools can make atmospheric analysis complicated. 
The Atmospheric Toolbox addresses these challenges.
